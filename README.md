# tiprotd

An implementation of multiple trivial and abadoned network protocols, with a twist.
It is written in Rust, using the low-level async library `mio`.

## Implemented protocols

* echo (TCP, UDP and UDPlite port 7, unix stream, seqpacket and datagram socket)
* discard (TCP, SCTP, UDP and UDPlite port 9, unix stream, seqpacket and datagram socket, posix message queue, pipe)
* daytime (TCP, UDP and UDPlite port 13, unix stream, seqpacket and datagram socket)
* QOTD (TCP, UDP and UDPlite port 17, unix stream, seqpacket and datagram socket)
* chargen (TCP, UDP and UDPlite port 17, unix stream, seqpacket and datagram socket)
* time (TCP, UDP and UDPlite port 37, unix stream, seqpacket and datagram socket)

To prevent being used for UDP amplification DDoS attacks, UDP replies are
limited to 1 MiB per IPv4 address or IPv6 /64 network within a 10 minute window
unless a TCP connection has been made from that IP.
Some protocols also send less data or don't respond to unverified clients.

The unix domain protocols listen to abstract addresses
in addition to path-based addresses in the current directory.

I plan to eventually also implement TCPMUX (port 1), TFTP (port 69) and Modbus TCP (port 502)
and want to also support the transport layer protocols DCCP and SCTP fully.

## Invocation

Command line arguments are ignored and there is no way to select which protocols to enable or where they listen.
Quotes to send from QOTD are read from quotes.txt in the current directory. Quotes are separated by lines starting with three or more dashes.
The content used for chargen is read from LICENSE.md.

If binding to the first port fails due to permission error, it will add 10000 to
the port numbers and try again. (so echo becomes port 10007 and time becomes port
10037)
It does not drop root privileges after setting up the listening sockets, so for
security it should be given the CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability and then run as
a normal user:

```sh
cargo build --release
sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip target/release/tiprotd
sudo -u nobody target/release/tiprotd
```

## Clients

For most protocols, netcat or socat is all you need;
For example use `nc -u localhost 10007` for UDP echo running on an unprivileged port or
`socat - TCP6:[::1]:10017` for TCP QOTD.

Tip: to make netcat terminate after receiving the TCP response, pass it the `-N` flag and redirect stdin to /dev/null: `nc -N 127.0.0.1 10017 </dev/null`

To find the listening sockets, (on Linux) run `ss --listening --query inet --numeric  -processes` or `sudo netstat --listening --numeric-ports --inet --inet6 --programs`.

In clients/ there are protocol-specific clients and simple programs I wrote to
get familiar with the transport layer protocols and sockets programming in general.
